libxt (1:1.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Fix manpage suffixes (Closes: #512130).
    - Real fix for #617208.
  * Drop patch accordingly:
    - 01-revert-switch-to-xtasprintf.diff
  * Switch to dh:
    - Use debhelper 8.
    - Use dh-autoreconf.
  * Remove xsfbs accordingly.
  * As a side-effect of looking at what really matters, fix the missing
    backslash when calling configure, preventing CFLAGS and LDFLAGS from
    being passed. Typo introduced in 1:1.0.6-1.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.1 (no changes needed).

 -- Cyril Brulebois <kibi@debian.org>  Thu, 10 Mar 2011 13:39:02 +0100

libxt (1:1.1.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

    init (Closes: #617208):
    + 01-revert-switch-to-xtasprintf.diff

 -- Cyril Brulebois <kibi@debian.org>  Mon, 07 Mar 2011 21:04:50 +0100

  * Update symbols file:
    + XtAsprintf

    this in place now).
  * Upload to unstable.

libxt (1:1.0.9-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Julien Cristau ]
  * Rename the build directory to not include DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE for no
    good reason.  Thanks, Colin Watson!
  * New upstream release.
  * Update debian/copyright from upstream COPYING.

  [ Robert Hooker ]
  * Don't install makestrs and its man page in libxt-dev, it's not shipped
    anymore.

  [ Christopher James Halse Rogers ]
  * New new upstream release.
  * Drop debian/patches/02_dont_export_private_deps.diff:
    - Upstream has trimmed the Required list in xt.pc, and a libXt header
      includes a #define which uses a libX11 symbol, so libX11 should be
      in the Requires field (and is).  This fixes lots of FTBFS with
      binutils-gold, which doesn't consider indirect dependencies.

  [ Cyril Brulebois ]
  * Update debian/copyright from upstream COPYING.
  * Exclude libXt.la in dh_install call.
  * Switch dh_install from --list-missing to --fail-missing for added
    safety.
  * Add myself to Uploaders.

 -- Julien Cristau <jcristau@debian.org>  Wed, 25 Nov 2009 19:55:18 +0100

libxt (1:1.0.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Julien Cristau ]
  * New upstream release.
  * Don't export dependencies on libSM and libX11 in the Requires field of
    xt.pc.  They're already in Requires.private, and do more harm than good in
    Requires.  Thanks to Stephen Gran and Margarita Manterola for noticing.
  * Remove Branden from Uploaders with his permission.
  * Don't build-depend on packages with a -1 debian revision.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.7.3.
  * Drop the XS- prefix from Vcs-* control fields.
  * Drop (pre-)dependencies on x11-common from libxt6 and libxt6-dbg, that's
    not needed.
  * Use ${binary:Version} instead of ${Source-Version}.
  * Remove pre-dependency on x11-common from libxt-dev, that was needed for
    upgrades from sarge.
  * Parse space-separated DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
  * Allow parallel builds.
  * Run autoreconf on build.
  * Remove patch 01_use_extern_C_in_headers.diff, applied upstream.
  * Use --with-xfile-search-path rather than setting XFILESEARCHPATHDEFAULT
    through CFLAGS directly.
  * Stop passing "-include X11/XlibConf.h" in CFLAGS; this was a hack
    introduced in 1:0.99.0+cvs.20050803-1, and unneeded since the upstream fix
    on Sep 24, 2005.
  * Cherry-pick patch from upstream git to link against libICE.

  [ Brice Goglin ]
  * Add a link to www.X.org and a reference to the upstream module
    in the long description.
  * Add upstream URL to debian/copyright.
  * Add README.source, bump Standards-Version to 3.8.3.
  * Use updated xsfbs, closes: #538592.
  * Move -dbg package to section debug.

  [ Loic Minier ]
  * Drop -Wl,-Bsymbolic-functions from LDFLAGS as it conflicts with the Xt
    inheritance mechanism; LP: #343574.

libxt (1:1.0.5-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add patch to libXt's headers to add _XFUNCPROTO{BEGIN,END} around a bunch
    of declarations.  This should fix the build of C++ apps using lesstif2
    (closes: #422353).

    idempotency fix.

  [ Drew Parsons ]
  * dbg package has priority extra.

  [ David Nusinow ]

libxt (1:0.99.0+cvs.20050803-3) breezy; urgency=low

libxt (1:0.99.0+cvs.20050803-2) breezy; urgency=low

    just accept that it works and move on with your life (closes:
    Ubuntu#14952).

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 12 Sep 2005 13:03:25 +1000

libxt (1:0.99.0+cvs.20050803-1) breezy; urgency=low

  * Take CVS snapshot from today, with patch #012 from the hulking monolith
    integrated upstream (fix drawing of StripCharts when scaled down).
  * Also fix building with XTHREADS (closes: Ubuntu#14824), by including
    XlibConf.h everywhere.  It's a hack, but I haven't the motivation to fix
    it.

libxt (1:0.1.5-3) breezy; urgency=low
